        "\n",
        "A ***batch job*** is a ***job*** (a unit of work) that will process data in batches.\n",
        "\n",
        "Batch jobs may be _scheduled_ in many ways:\n",

        "* Weekly\n",
        "* Daily (very common)\n",

        "* Python scripts (like the [data pipelines in lesson 1](1_intro.md#creating-a-custom-pipeline-with-docker)).\n",

        "\n",
        "Batch jobs are commonly orchestrated with tools such as [Airflow](2_data_ingestion.md#airflow-architecture).\n",
        "\n",
        "A common workflow for batch jobs may be the following:\n",
        "\n",
        "```mermaid\n",
        "  graph LR;\n",
        "      A(DataLake CSV)-->B(Python);\n",

        "## Pros and cons of batch jobs\n",
        "\n",
        "* Advantages:\n",
        "    * Easy to manage. There are multiple tools to manage them (the technologies we already mentioned)\n",
        "    * Re-executable. Jobs can be easily retried if they fail.\n",
        "    * Scalable. Scripts can be executed in more capable machines; Spark can be run in bigger clusters, etc.\n",
        "* Disadvantages:\n",
        "    * Delay. Each task of the workflow in the previous section may take a few minutes; assuming the whole workflow takes 20 minutes, we would need to wait those 20 minutes until the data is ready for work.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, the advantages of batch jobs often compensate for its shortcomings, and as a result most companies that deal with data tend to work with batch jobs mos of the time (probably 90%).\n",

        "\n",
        "The wrapper for Python is called [PySpark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/).\n",
        "\n",
        "Spark can deal with both batches and streaming data. The technique for streaming data is seeing a stream of data as a sequence of small batches and then applying similar techniques on them to those used on regular badges. We will cover streaming in detail in the next lesson.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "There are tools such as Hive, Presto or Athena (a AWS managed Presto) that allow you to express jobs as SQL queries. However, there are times where you need to apply more complex manipulation which are very difficult or even impossible to express with SQL (such as ML models); in those instances, Spark is the tool to use.\n",
